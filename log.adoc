== Before Starting This Log

* I've created a program that can gather metadata on projects from Github
** Program has several stages:
... Search github for repositories
... Download metadata on repositories
... Download the content of different commits and analyze the Javascript files
* I've downloaded and analyzed the first 100 top javascript repositories (by stars) by
sampling the last commit of years 2009, 2012, 2015 and 2018.
** Analysis showed some trend of moving reducing the use of C-style for loops
in favor of other iteration constructs.
* I've written a 45 minutes talk about the topic that was presented in Lambda Days 2019

. [x] Get the first 1000 results from Github

. [ ] Gather metadata for the new projects
